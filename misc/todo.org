* Themes
** Gruvbox-light
- *qutebrowser*
  - move qutebrowser theme to themes directory => Makefile.
    - this can probably only happen after
      [[https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/499]] or
      [[https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/381]] because the
      [colors] section will be re-added after every update anyway.
  - remove coloured backgrounds from different status bar types, and make
    them coloured foregrounds instead.
- *pentadactyl*

* Other
- use environment variables for theme settings, as much as possible.
  - xmonad and the panel's settings have gruvbox-light theme settings
    hardcoded into them.
- copy over the patch and generic.nix files for custom rustc nix expressions?
- qutebrowser git clone in bootstrap script should somehow correspond/checkout
  to the correct commit.
- add limey to fonts options => figure out size issue (because it's bitmap
  anyway), and find out if it required negative letter space..
- make the vim swap file section in the global gitignore (and gitignores of
  other repositories) the same as the one in this repository.
- shell => search command history.
- rewrite upd script to only update emacs packages if :files (from recipe)
  changed.
- use relative paths in scripts by first cd'ing to the directory the script is
  located in: [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/4093264]] ?
  - OR, use environment variables instead ??
- pandoc and latex templates.
